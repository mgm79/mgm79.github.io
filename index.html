<br>Hello there! I'm M.G. Mashiku, currently a student, studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">Data Science and Analytics</a>, and trying to understand, Spacetime phenomena and dynamic systems, advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/andrepython">Andre Python</a>.<br><br>

My research interests lie in the application of machine learning methods for both euclidean and non euclidean dynamic systems. I am currently working on tools for calciomics, <b>Mathematical Literacy</b> and <b>Geometric Deep-Learning</b> in international relations and malaria epidemiology.<br><br>

I was an intern at <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/goddard">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a> in Greenbelt, Maryland and <a href="https://malariaatlas.org/group/geospatial-risk-stratification-elimination-mapping/">Malaria Atlas Project (MAP)</a> at Oxford University.<br><br>

When Iâ€™m not doing ML, I like to work out, row, play piano, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/50448521?shelf=read">read</a>.<br>
