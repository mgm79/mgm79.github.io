<br>Hello there! I'm M.G. Mashiku, currently a student and independent ML researcher, studying <a href="https://micromasters.mit.edu/dedp/">Data, Economics and Development Policy (DEDP)</a>, and trying to understand, spatial temporal phenomena and dynamic systems, advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/andrepython">Andre Python</a>. 
My research interests lie in the application of machine learning methods for non euclidean data and dynamic systems. I am currently working on tools for <b>Mathematical literacy</b> and <b>geometric deep learning</b> in International Relations and malaria epidemiology.<br><br>

<br>

When Iâ€™m not doing ML, I like to work out, row, play piano, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/50448521?shelf=read">read</a>.<br>
