<br>Hello there! I'm Mel Mashiku, currently interested in <a href="https://geometricdeeplearning.com">Geometric Deep Learning (GDL)</a>. Performing research towards characterizing complex dynamical systems and their control with supervision by Professors <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/">J. Nathan Kutz</a> and <a href="https://www.eigensteve.com">Steven L. Brunton</a> at the <a href="https://dynamicsai.org/page-2/uw/">AI Institute in Dynamic Systems</a>.<br><br>

My research interests are in the application of category theory to understanding machine learning methods for both euclidean and non euclidean dynamical systems. I previously worked on tools for <a href="https://calciomics.org">Molecular Dynamics</a>, <b>Explainable AI</b> and <b>Geometric Deep-Learning</b> in international relations and malaria epidemiology.<br><br>

I was an intern at <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/goddard">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a> in Greenbelt, Maryland and <a href="https://malariaatlas.org/group/geospatial-risk-stratification-elimination-mapping/">Malaria Atlas Project (MAP)</a> at Oxford University mentored by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/andrepython">Andre Python</a> and <a href="https://www.idmod.org/user/211">Katherine Battle</a>.<br><br>

When Iâ€™m not doing ML, I like to watch movies, listen to podcasts and read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/50448521?shelf=read">read</a>.<br>
