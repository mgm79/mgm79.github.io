This is a brief tutorial and introduction to the *Mathematical literacy* pedagogy technique 
called mathematical mechanics, which is an approach to understanding computational and mathematical thinking. 
This post will be a priming walk through the foundations of mathematical mechanics, and this focuses 
on building mental models that can fit into the broader conceptual space.

Some backstory: a few years ago, I decided to take a look at the productivity literature 
and try to understand how to simplify my learning with metacognitive practice. This quest yielded many fruitful insights, 
but also left me with some open questions. The goal of this post is twofold: to provide 
a resource for people who wish to better understand mathematics, and to act as a field guide companion for those *ultralearning* complex mathematics.
